      "intro": "This project is inspired by my own experience of preparing the PTE exam (a computer-based academic English test). When practicing the speaking section, I found it is inconvenient to manually set up two timers to count down the preparation time and speaking time sequentially. As a result, I built an easy-to-use online timer which is similar to the one in real test so that it could help PTE test-takers to practice more efficiently and get less distractions. ",

        "intro": "I felt I did not make any improvement beside of doing the same things every day, so I came up with a solution for myself that is randomly picking up a small task to accomplish each day. However, with the list of tasks become longer, it is inefficient to control which tasks should be included for the random pick that day. After learned React, I found it is a great opportunity to turn this idea into a web application with an improved tasks selection system and more tasks. ",
